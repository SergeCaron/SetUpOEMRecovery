# About the Windows Recovery Media (and Bare Metal Restore)

Any modern Windows installation can create a "Recovery Drive" containing utilities to troubleshoot and possibly restore the system. Subject to Microsoft's restrictions, the target of the Bare Metal Restore can be different hardware, making the "Recovery Drive" a valuable tool.

There are caveats:
1. The Recovery Drive utility creator MAY not include all OEM drivers, in particular critical RAID and network drivers required to access the system itself or the system backup.

2. It may not be possible to slipstream these drivers into the Recovery Media Windows image : the DISM utility will not update WIM files larger than 4GB (split across multiple .SWM files).

3. There are issues accessing iSCSI disks containing these backups. The Windows "Installation Media" (ISO, DVD, USB key) cannot be used in lieu of the "Recovery Drive" because the MSiSCSI service is not configured in this environment and utilities such as iscsicli are not available on the "Installation Media".

4. Beginning with Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022, the MSiSCSI service will not start in the Windows PE environment used by the "Recovery Drive". This is documented in Microsoft Case #2304230060000186. A workaround is required to start MSiSCSI. See below for more information.

The focus of this project is to use the Microsoft utilities as is to configure a "Recovery Drive" and achieve the troubleshooting and/or bare metal restore required by your situation.

Windows Server Backup or one of its workstation variants (Windows Backup, System Image Backup, etc.) is used to create the system image required to restore the system: this is not covered here.

There are two scripts in this project:
1. SetUpOEMRecovery will create/update a "Recovery Drive" for the system at hand. The script creates a DRIVERS directory in the root of the "Recovery Drive" and dumps all OEM drivers there. It then copies itself as well as the PnPUtil.exe utility, a recovery helper script (and an empty Windows XML Event Log, documented below).

2. RECOVER.CMD is the helper script that will configure the Windows PE environment in order to access (hopefully) all system components and perform a Bare Metal Restore, if need be. This includes initializing the network stack in Windows PE, starting required services such as MSiSCSI and the DNS client, and starting the disk configuration utility. As a convenience, the script will also launch BMRUI.EXE, the "Bare Metal Restore" utility: this utility is only vailable in the Windows PE environment. 

Note: The Windows XML Event Log (EVTX) format is documented in *[Windows XML Event Log (EVTX) format](https://github.com/libyal/libevtx/blob/main/documentation/Windows%20XML%20Event%20Log%20(EVTX).asciidoc)*. The Windows PE environment has no utility to create an empty event file. If you don't want to use the binary file provided with this project, you can copy any log from the %SystemRoot%\System32\WinEVT\Logs that has the minimum size of 69Â 632 bytes under the name Empty.evtx in the same directory as the above two scripts. On startup, RECOVER.CMD will display the headers of whatever file it will supply to the Event logger service.

# SetUpOEMRecovery

## Purpose:

Create a UEFI or MBR recovery media on a USB key containing the OEM drivers installed on the system. 
 
Drivers may be collected from multiple systems to allow using a single USB key for their maintenance.

Options allow
 removal of DISPLAY, MEDIA, BLUETOOTH, PRINTER, SOFTWARECOMPONENT drivers as well as vey large drivers (typically
 wireless NICs). These drivers are generally useless in the Windows PE environment.

The script also copies support files to initiate a bare metal restore of the system once booted
from the recovery key. This is a companion project.

------
>**Caution:**	This script requires **elevated** execution privileges.

Quoting from Microsoft's "about_Execution_Policies" : "PowerShell's
execution policy is a safety feature that controls the conditions
under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts."

Use any configuration that is the equivalent of the
following commnand executed from an elevated PowerShell prompt:

			Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
------

## Operation:

- [ ] Open an elevated PowerShell prompt.
- [ ] Invoke the script, insert a USB key and press enter. The script will prompt for a USB key until a compatible device is inserted.
- [ ] The script scans compatible USB drives for a ?:\sources\Reconstruct.WIM windows image file. If no such file is found, the script invokes the Microsoft RecoveryDrive utility. You have the option to reinitialize an existing recovery drive. Note that this utility will enumerate 'Fixed' and 'Removable' drive types, not just the selected drive. This process is repeated until a single compatible drive is identified. 
- [ ] The script dumps all OEM drivers in the ?:\Drivers directory of the USB drive. You have the option to remove drivers that are not usually used in the Windows PE environment.
- [ ] The script copies itself, the RECOVER.CMD script, and the Empty.evtx file in the root of the USB drive. These files must be in th same directory.
- [ ] An enumeration of all OEM drivers present on the drive is displayed

# Recover.CMD

## Purpose:

Configure at runtime the target system in order to access the network and optionnaly perform a Bare Metal Restore.

## Operation

Upon successful booting, the Windows Recovery Environment menu is displayed. At a minimum, troubleshooting options are always available:

![Option_1](Ressources/Option_Troubleshoot.jpg)

In order to configure the system, we need to access a command prompt:

![Option_2](Ressources/Option_Command_Prompt.jpg)

The Windows PE is running from a RAM disk labeled X:\ and does not provide a variable pointing to the real boot drive.

Issue the command { **mountvol | find ":\\"** } (without the braces ;-) and find the RECOVER.CMD script.

The script presumes the system is connected to a network but does not presume any particular configuration other than Automatic IP Addressing in the absence of a DHCP server. In the following example, the system under test is connected directly to a NAS using a network cable.

You have the option to install the OEM drivers stored on the USB drive.

You should review the disk configuration before continuing. In particular, some Bare Metal Restore fail even if you are restoring the backup of the original system. In this instance, it is better to "clean" the partition table before attempting the Bare Metal Restore.

You have the option to connect to a iSCSI target by specifying its name (preferred) or IP address. The script will enumerate all available targets and you will need to select one.

Finally, the script will start the BMRUI utility to allow restoring from either a local source (including iSCSI) or a remote share.

You can abort and restart the script at any time.

For some reason, the service appears to validate the Event Log service configuration and will issue this error if the System.evtx is not available. The service will also fail with error 2 (file not found) if the Application.evtx log file is not available.

As a simple workaround, the EventLog service is stopped, an empty log file of minimum size is copied under both names and the EventLog service is started.

In order to provide coherent time references, the W32Time service is also started and the headers of both event logs are displayed, for sanity reasons.

Note that stopping the W32Time service will also result in error 2 (File not Found): you can conclude that some other Event Log file is missing ;-).

You can reuse this code in your own recovery media, with the above copyright.

```

# Converting a Hyper-V virtual machine to a physical machine

Hyper-V virtual machines have no direct access to removable USB drives.

Using some virtual USB server, you can run the SetUpOEMRecovery script within the virtual machine to create a physical Recovery Drive on the virtual USB server. You can then use this USB drive to boot a physical BIOS/UEFI compatible system and proceed to a bare metal restore of the virtal machine.

This strategy was successfully tested with third party software Virtual Here (https://www.virtualhere.com/). The process involved no modification to the above scripts, no modfication to the virtual machine and no modification to the workstation hosting the Recovery Drive. Your mileage may vary.
